                    Hello, my name is Louella Mortel and I am currently a 3rd year in SFSU with a Visual Communication Major and Computer Science minor.
                    <br>
                    I have been in the Bay Area since I was 5 years old and before that I was in the Philippines! Some of my current goals are enhancing my skills <br>
                    in programming and design to go on the path of a UI/UX designer. I have a passion and great interest in learning the front-end and back-end <br>
                    of developing user experiences and interfaces. Some of my interests right now are drawing during my free time, crocheting, spending time with <br>
                    my friends and boyfriend, and also just playing games. I also hope to be able to contribute to a video game if I ever could in the future. <br>
                    3D printing and design is something that has been an interest of mine too but I have never really gotten into it. Recently I have been very <br> 
                    interested in playing games in a whole lot of different genres such as Until Then, Monster Hunter, Stardew Valley, Genshin Impact, and much more.<br>
                    Some of my favorites are the simple games that I play with my friends such as on roblox or even minecraft. <br>
                    I enjoy spending time with my friends and boyfriend as they are the ones that lighten up my stressful school day!
