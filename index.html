                Hello! My name is Louella Mortel and I am currently a 3rd year in SFSU with a Visual Communication Major and for now, a Computer Science Minor. 
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am also currently working at Health Promotion & Wellness as a Marketing Coordinator to help promote health and wellness on our platforms!
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to that, I am also a design intern at SF HACKS, part of the ACM club (Association for Computing Machinery)!

            <p>
                I have been in the Bay Area since I was 5 years old and before that, I was in the Philippines! I was raised in a Filipina household and even then, I can't speak the languageâ€¦ however I can still understand!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I used to draw a lot when I was younger and throughout the years I have always wanted to pursue an artistic career. As I kept growing, I also got a huge interest in technology and sparked my interests in combining the two, art and tech. My goals in the future is to become a UI/ UX designer or somewhere along the lines. Outside of that though, I would love to have my own cafe or bakery, living life peacefully!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I love to draw and sketch during my freetime and I love playing games with friends and my boyfriend. Some of the recent games I've played and enjoyed were Monster Hunter World, Stardew Valley, Honkai Star Rail, Mario Kart, Until Then, and the Sims 4. Some of the other activities I like to do are playing badminton, struggle with crochet, going to K-Pop concerts (if I can afford), and baking cookies! I also just enjoy visiting cafes or new food places with friends c: !</p>

                    Hello, my name is Louella Mortel and I am currently a 3rd year in SFSU with a Visual Communication Major and Computer Science minor.
                    <br>
                    I have been in the Bay Area since I was 5 years old and before that I was in the Philippines! Some of my current goals are enhancing my skills <br>
                    in programming and design to go on the path of a UI/UX designer. I have a passion and great interest in learning the front-end and back-end <br>
                    of developing user experiences and interfaces. Some of my interests right now are drawing during my free time, crocheting, spending time with <br>
                    my friends and boyfriend, and also just playing games. I also hope to be able to contribute to a video game if I ever could in the future. <br>
                    3D printing and design is something that has been an interest of mine too but I have never really gotten into it. Recently I have been very <br> 
                    interested in playing games in a whole lot of different genres such as Until Then, Monster Hunter, Stardew Valley, Genshin Impact, and much more.<br>
                    Some of my favorites are the simple games that I play with my friends such as on roblox or even minecraft. <br>
                    I enjoy spending time with my friends and boyfriend as they are the ones that lighten up my stressful school day!
