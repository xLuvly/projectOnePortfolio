                <h4>This artist inspires me because of their sharp and confident lineart along with their good use of colors
                    that have a unique pop.</h4>

                <h4>This artist inspires me because of how well they do their lightings and environment especially since they are one of the 
                    artists in Spiderverse, a film which is known to be very artistic.</h4>

                <h4>This artist has been an inspiration in my life with the way they create meaning behind their works. Each work of theirs 
                    correlates to how this artist has been doing regarding their health. They are no longer with us and yet they are still one of 
                    my biggest inspirations to this day.
